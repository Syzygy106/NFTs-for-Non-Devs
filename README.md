# NFT Business Cases Starter Kit

A practical, production-ready collection of NFT smart contract templates built with Foundry. Each template represents a complete business case with contracts, tests, deployment scripts, and step-by-step guides.

---

## üéØ Who This Is For

- **Creators & Artists** ‚Äî Deploy your NFT collection without writing code from scratch
- **Small Teams** ‚Äî Get production-ready templates with built-in best practices
- **Developers** ‚Äî Skip boilerplate and start with tested, documented patterns
- **Educators** ‚Äî Compare different minting strategies side-by-side

---

## üì¶ What's Inside

This repository contains **multiple self-contained Foundry projects**, each representing a distinct NFT business case. Every scenario includes:

- ‚úÖ **Smart contracts** (`src/`) ‚Äî Clean, minimal, auditable code
- ‚úÖ **Deploy scripts** (`script/Deploy.s.sol`) ‚Äî One-command deployment
- ‚úÖ **Tests** (`test/`) ‚Äî Full test coverage
- ‚úÖ **Documentation** (per-scenario `HowToDeploy.md`) ‚Äî Step-by-step deployment guide
- ‚úÖ **Configuration** (`foundry.toml`) ‚Äî Pre-configured for EVM networks

All contracts use **Solidity 0.8.24** and **OpenZeppelin v5** APIs.

## üóÇÔ∏è Available Scenarios

Browse the `EVM_Contracts/` folder for complete implementations:

### üìå Scenario 1: Classic Drop (ERC-721A + Batch Mint)
**Path:** `EVM_Contracts/scenario_1/`

**Use case:** Mint your entire collection upfront, then list on marketplaces (OpenSea, Magic Eden, etc.)

**Tech stack:**
- ERC-721A (gas-efficient batch minting)
- ERC-2309 (consecutive transfer event)
- Batch mint entire supply in constructor
- Owner-controlled metadata with freeze mechanism

**Best for:** Traditional PFP collections, art drops, merch NFTs

### üîú Coming Soon

- **Scenario 2:** Public Mint with Merkle Whitelist
- **Scenario 3:** Lazy Minting (off-chain vouchers)
- **Scenario 4:** Dutch Auction
- **Scenario 5:** Bonding Curve Minting
- **Scenario 6:** Secret Word Minting

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Foundry**  
```bash
   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
   foundryup
```
   Full guide: https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation

2. **Get testnet ETH**  
   Use a faucet for Sepolia or your chosen testnet

### Choose Your Scenario

Each scenario is **fully self-contained** and includes its own detailed deployment guide:

1. Navigate to the scenario folder (e.g., `EVM_Contracts/scenario_1/`)
2. Open `HowToDeploy.md` inside for complete step-by-step instructions
3. Follow the configuration, build, test, and deployment steps

**Example:**
```bash
cd EVM_Contracts/scenario_1
cat HowToDeploy.md  # Read the full guide
```

Each scenario's README covers:
- Prerequisites and dependencies
- Configuration options (environment variables, `.env` file, inline parameters)
- Build and test commands
- Deployment instructions
- Post-deployment steps (verification, marketplace listing)
- Troubleshooting tips

## üìñ How to Use This Repository

### Option 1: Copy a Single Scenario

Each scenario folder is **fully self-contained**. You can:
```bash
# Copy just the scenario you need
cp -r scenarios/scenario_1_classic_drop my-nft-project
cd my-nft-project

# It works independently
forge build
forge test
```

### Option 2: Explore & Compare

Keep the full repo and navigate between scenarios to compare approaches:
```bash
# Compare gas costs
cd scenarios/scenario_1_classic_drop && forge test --gas-report
cd ../scenario_2_merkle_mint && forge test --gas-report

# Compare deployment complexity
diff scenario_1_classic_drop/script/Deploy.s.sol scenario_3_lazy_mint/script/Deploy.s.sol
```

### Option 3: Build Your Own Hybrid

Mix features from different scenarios:

- Take batch minting from Scenario 1
- Add whitelist logic from Scenario 2
- Combine with royalty setup from Scenario 3

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Tasks

### Build contracts
```bash
forge build
```

### Run tests
```bash
forge test

# With gas report
forge test --gas-report

# Verbose output
forge test -vvv
```

### Deploy to testnet
```bash
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL \
  --broadcast \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

### Verify contract
```bash
forge verify-contract \
  --chain sepolia \
  --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY \
  <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> \
  src/YourContract.sol:YourContract
```

### Format code
```bash
forge fmt
```

### Local development node
```bash
anvil
```
